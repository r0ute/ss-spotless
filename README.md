# Spotless Plugin for Supermarket Simulator

**Spotless Plugin** removes garbage spawn and dusting from the game, creating a cleaner, more enjoyable supermarket experience. This plugin gives you control over two key features: garbage spawning (which includes dirt) and dusting, allowing you to disable them if you prefer a tidier environment.

## Features

- **Disable Garbage Spawn**: Prevents garbage and dirt from spawning in the supermarket, keeping your store clean and tidy.
- **Disable Dusting**: Removes the dusting mechanic, so you don't have to worry about cleaning up the shelves.

## Configuration

The plugin provides configuration options that can be adjusted in the `BepInEx/config` folder:

- **SpawnGarbage**: Set to `false` to disable garbage (including dirt) spawning (default: `false`).
- **Dusting**: Set to `false` to disable dusting mechanics (default: `false`).
